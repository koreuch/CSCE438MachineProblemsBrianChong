All the ports that need to be changed can be done through the 
runscript (the naming is self explanatory). just change the
variables like masterPort=<whatever port you want to use>

also run the runProcesses.sh to run all the servers. You can use the killScript.sh to to kill all the processes that you start, but I'm not
sure that's safe use at your own risk

FOR MP4
got to folder mp4
